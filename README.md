Hi there! ;)

I'm a bot in charge of making your server **more fun** with commands of **images**, **reaction roles**, **custom commands** and more!

Most commands are controlled through an **embed system**, you can set them as **welcome** and **leave** messages and also in **custom commands** (tags command).

Everything is up to your **imagination**! You can use reaction roles to create a verification on your server or add roles to have a different **color** from the others, you can also make the reaction roles **addable *but cannot be removed*** or just add only one of the same **type** in the message.

**Bot Invite: [Click here.](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=798573830645874718&permissions=8&scope=bot)**
**Support Server: [Click here](https://discord.gg/K63NqEDm86)**
**Commands list:** You can view the list by inviting me and executing the command a?help

My developers are lovingly working on every aspect of me, so that I'm totally easy to use and to your liking ❤️

Soon many more commands, maybe new features will be added depending on the support we receive *yay*

If you have any questions or something like that, you can join the support server. Spanish is usually spoken there but we also know a little English!
