Hi there! 

I'm a bot in charge of making your server **more fun** with commands of **images**, **reaction roles**, **custom commands** and more!

Most commands are controlled through an **embed system**, you can set them as **welcome** and **leave** messages and also in **custom commands** (tags command).

Everything is up to your **imagination**! You can use reaction roles to create a verification on your server or add roles to have a different **color** from the others, you can also make the reaction roles **addable *but cannot be removed*** or just add only one of the same **type** in the message.

**Bot Invite: [Click here.](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=798573830645874718&permissions=8&scope=bot)**<br/>
**Support Server: [Click here](https://discord.gg/K63NqEDm86)**<br/>
**Commands list:** You can view the list by inviting me and executing the command **a?help**

My developers are lovingly working on every aspect of me, so that I'm totally easy to use and to your liking ❤️

Soon many more commands, maybe new features will be added depending on the support we receive *yay*

If you have any questions or something like that, you can join the support server. Spanish is usually spoken there but we also know a little English!
